		<p class="pone">Maybe you're reading this by accident, or a friend shared it to you but I'm glad you are. <br><br> I want to remind you that you are not alone. You are being cared for and loved my someone out there and you might not just know it yet. <br><br> Maybe this Christmas you were meant to spend it alone to discover new things about yourself, to rebuild and become stronger. This Christmas is your Christmas to focus on loving every part of you, and enjoying to company of just you. <br><br> Every year won't be like this, because as you get to fall in love with yourself you'll have new goals, new dreams and you'll meet people who'll be wonderful, authentic and will make you better as a person. They can be the ones you'll be spending celebrations and dinners with. <br><br> I want to remind you that despite being alone on Christmas, this occasion is a celebration of the birth of your savior, the birth of hope for eternal life where no pain, no lonliness, no hurt will be experienced. You'll be filled with joy, love, and peace. Where no tears will be wept except happy ones and no desire is to difficult to achieve. <br><br> You may be lonely at the moment but know you aren't alone and there are people you can turn to if you reach out and surely God will send the right people in your life that will bring you true happiness where you can be yourself one hundred percent. <br><br> Just be patient, just enjoy the silence, just embrae your situation, but keep your eyes on the horizon. <br><br> Merry Christmas, <br> you're loved. </p>
